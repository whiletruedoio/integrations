# Shields

At [while-true-do.io], we are using shields to present information in a simple
way. Shields can re-present Release Versions, Links to Chat, display followers
and much more.

## Reasons

- easy to use
- works on website, different docs formats like Markdown or ASCII Doc
- lot's of tuning options
- no tracking

## Links & Docs

- Site: <https://shields.io>
- Code: <https://github.com/badges/shields>

## Features

- svg images
- easy on the eyes
- very huge library
- custom shields possible

## Usage

You just need to create your badge at [shields.io](https://shields.io) and copy
the desired code snippet in your file. For markdown, this may look something
like this:

```markdown
![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/whiletruedoio?style=for-the-badge)
```

And the result will be:

![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/whiletruedoio?style=for-the-badge)

## Integration

There is no specific integration needed, but we are using Shields in different
places. For example:

- prepared shields in the
  [template repository](https://github.com/whiletruedoio/template)
- display some information in our
  [profile README.md](https://github.com/whiletruedoio/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md)
