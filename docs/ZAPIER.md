# Zapier

[Zapier](https://zapier.com) is an automation service, that can poll or receive
push events to perform certain actions. It is a lot like IFTT and similar
software/services. We use Zapier at [while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io)
to automate things, that don't have a 1st-level integration for our services.
