# Uptimerobot

[Uptimerobot](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/zKXjluyAr/) is our go-to-app for
monitoring of services and applications. It is free, easy to use and provides
integrations and alerts via Slack, Mail and much more.

## Reasons

- already in use for quite some time
- free checks at 5 minute intervalls
- monitoring of http, icmp and custom ports

## Features

- free for 5 minute checks
- API for automation
- status page
- alerts via Slack, Mail, SMS and more

## Usage

From a user perspective there is not much to know about. We do have our own
statuspage available [here](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/zKXjluyAr/) and will
add automatic setup, maintenance and deletion of new checks. If you find some
service not working properly, please check the statuspage or slack channels.

## Integrations

For now, UptimeRobot is sending mails and alerts in [Slack](SLACK.md).

- mail alerts
- Slack #monitoring channel
