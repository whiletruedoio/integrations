# Minikube

Minikube is a CNCF certified software to run a very minimal Kubernetes instance
on your local machine. This is extremely useful in development, since you don't
require any central hardware.

## Reasons

- local development of Kubernetes deployments
- very good support
- very good integrations in other software
- very well documented and maintained
- supports Docker, Podman and other Backends

## Docs & Links

- Site: <https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/>
- Docs: <https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/>
- Code: <https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube>

## Features

- addons like ingress or dashboard
- multiple backends
- multiple instances
- runs on Windows, MacOS, Linux
- very lightweight

## Usage

Minikube is used exclusively for local development at
[while-true-do.io](https://while-true-do.io). It is intended to lower the
barrier to get started with Kubernetes development and deployments.

### Getting Started

The Minikube developer provide some very easy tutorials and
[Getting Started Guidance](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/). It is by
far not easy to get started with Kubernetes, but it is easy to get started with
Minikube. :)
